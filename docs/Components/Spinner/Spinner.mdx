# Spinner
A spinner is a loading indicator that informs users that a process is ongoing. It is typically displayed when the system is retrieving or processing data, preventing users from taking further action until the operation is complete.

### Usage

Use a spinner to indicate that a process is in progress and the user needs to wait. Spinners are best suited for short, indeterminate loading times where progress cannot be measured.

**Use cases:**

-   Providing feedback during transitions between views.
-   Displaying a spinner while fetching data or loading content.
-   Indicating system processes such as form submissions or authentication.
