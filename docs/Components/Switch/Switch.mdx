# Switch
Switches are selection controls that toggle a single setting on or off. They are used for actions that take immediate effect without requiring additional confirmation, such as enabling notifications, turning on dark mode, or activating a feature. Switches provide a clear visual indication of the current state, making them ideal for settings that users can quickly change.
