# Menu Button (Bug)
A Common Button is a primary interactive component used to trigger an action or event in a user interface. It serves as a key element for guiding user interactions, providing clear affordances for clickable actions.

## Overview
### Types

-  **Fill**: A button with a solid background color, providing maximum visual emphasis for primary actions.
-  **Outline**: A button with a border and a transparent background, offering a balanced, secondary-level emphasis.
-  **Ghost**: A minimalist button with no background or border, ideal for subtle actions or less critical interactions.

### Button Styles

-  **Primary:** A style used to highlight the most important action on a screen, typically with a strong, prominent color.
-  **Secondary:** A style for supporting actions, offering a less visually dominant alternative to the primary button.
-  **Error:** A style indicating critical or destructive actions, using alert colors to draw user attention to potential consequences.
