### Size
Avatars are available in sizes ranging from 16 to 120 pixels, providing flexibility for various use cases. Larger sizes (e.g., 120px) are ideal for profile pages, while smaller sizes (e.g., 16px) are suited for compact UI elements like lists or toolbars. Using consistent sizes ensures visual clarity and maintains hierarchy.
