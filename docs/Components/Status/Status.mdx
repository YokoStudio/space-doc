# Status
A status indicator provides users with clear feedback about the current state of a system, process, or element. It helps maintain user awareness by conveying information such as success, errors, warnings, or availability. Status can be temporary (e.g., success or error messages) or persistent (e.g., system availability or connectivity status).

## Overview

### Types

-   **Default:** A default status provides general information about a system, process, or element without indicating an issue. It helps users stay informed about the current state, such as progress updates or system availability.
-   **Error:** An error status alerts users to a problem that needs attention. It highlights issues such as failed actions, system errors, or incorrect inputs, guiding users toward resolving the issue.

### Usage

**Indicating System State:**
Use status text to inform users about the current state of a system or process, such as "Connected" or "Loading...".

**Providing Feedback:**
Display status messages to confirm successful actions (e.g., "Saved successfully") or alert users to issues (e.g., "Failed to load data").

**Error Handling:**
Use error statuses to highlight problems and guide users toward resolution, such as "Invalid password" or "Network error. Try again."

**Persistent or Temporary Updates:**
Apply persistent statuses for ongoing system conditions (e.g., "Server maintenance mode") and temporary statuses for real-time feedback (e.g., "Uploading file...").
