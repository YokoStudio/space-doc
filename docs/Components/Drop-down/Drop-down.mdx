# Drop-down
A dropdown is a component that allows users to select an option from a list. It provides a compact way to present multiple choices while keeping the interface clean.

## Overview
### State

-   **Close:** In the closed state, we support interactive states such as hover, press, and focus
-   **Open:** In the opened, the dropdown reveals a menu containing selectable options(Our dropdowns utilize the **menu component** for displaying options, ensuring consistency in behavior and appearance.)

### Usage

Use a dropdown to present a list of options in a compact and efficient way. Dropdowns help streamline interfaces by hiding options until they are needed, reducing clutter and improving usability.

Use case

-   Selecting a single option from multiple choices (e.g., choosing a country, language, or category).
-   Providing a list of actions in a menu (e.g., profile settings, logout).
-   Filtering content dynamically (e.g., sorting items in a list).

### Behaviour

    <TabItem value="Close" label="default" default>
